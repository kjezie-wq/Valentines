Hi.

If you’re reading this, it means you received a small link from me.

Please don’t open it right away.

Open it when:
	•	You’re alone.
	•	You’re somewhere quiet.
	•	You’re not rushing.
	•	And when you can give it a few uninterrupted minutes.

This isn’t a prank.
It isn’t a joke.
And it isn’t something I made lightly.

It’s just something honest.

No pressure.
No expectations.
Just something from the heart.

When you’re ready…
click the link.

— Someone who values you more than you probably know ❤️
